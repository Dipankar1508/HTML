        Ravana, a central character in Hindu mythology and the Ramayana epic, is often depicted as a complex and
        multi-faceted figure. Here's a brief "biography" of Ravana based on the traditional narratives:
        <br>
        **Birth and Lineage:**
        - Ravana was born to the sage Vishrava and his wife Kaikesi, who was a demoness (Rakshasi). Due to his mixed
        parentage, Ravana possessed both human and demon-like qualities.
        - He was a member of the Rakshasa race, known for their immense strength and supernatural powers.
        <br>
        **Early Life:**
        - Ravana was highly intelligent from a young age and became a devoted worshiper of Lord Shiva, earning the god's
        favor through his penance and devotion.
        - He acquired extensive knowledge of scriptures, warfare, and magic, making him a formidable scholar and
        warrior.
        <br>
        **Conquest of Lanka:**
        - Ravana's ambition led him to conquer the island of Lanka (modern-day Sri Lanka) and establish it as his
        kingdom.
        - He gained a reputation for his military prowess and ruthlessness as a ruler.
        <br>
        **Abduction of Sita:**
        - One of the most well-known actions associated with Ravana is the abduction of Sita, the wife of Lord Rama, who
        was an incarnation of Lord Vishnu.
        - Ravana lured Sita away from Lord Rama while she was in exile with him in the forest.
        <br>
        **Conflict with Lord Rama:**
        - Ravana's abduction of Sita triggered a series of events that led to a great war between him and Lord Rama.
        - Lord Rama, along with his allies, including the monkey-god Hanuman, assembled an army to rescue Sita and
        defeat Ravana.
        <br>
        **War and Defeat:**
        - The war between Ravana and Lord Rama, known as the Ramayana War, was a fierce and epic battle that lasted for
        several days.
        - Ultimately, Ravana was defeated by Lord Rama in a climactic battle, with Rama firing a powerful arrow that
        struck Ravana's chest, leading to his demise.
        <br>
        **Death and Legacy:**
        - Ravana's death marked the end of his rule and the restoration of Sita to Lord Rama.
        - While Ravana is often seen as a villain due to his actions, he is also considered a complex character, with
        his devotion to Lord Shiva and his significant achievements in various fields.
        <br>
        Ravana's story has been retold and adapted in various forms of literature, art, and performance throughout South
        Asia. It continues to be a source of fascination and serves as a moral and ethical lesson about the consequences
        of one's actions and the importance of dharma (righteousness).
